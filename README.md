# YouTube_Music_Downloader
## How does music downloader work?
it is a simple program that downloads the video from youtube and then converts it to audio format, it works through multithreading so it is quite fast

## How set up the downloader
* install python
* install correct library with pip
* create your own list.txt file where you put the links to download, and replace the PATH variable. (list.txt must be in the same folder as index.py)
* (The link format must be: https://youtu.be/..., it is very important that the link begins with http/https otherwise it may not work)

## Now compile and run
